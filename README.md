## Image Search App

#About

This project was built with CSS, HTML, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Vite. It utilizes the Unsplash API. This project was a great chance for me to refresh on how to integrate API's into my projects. The user of this app will be able to search for images that are retrieved from the Unsplash website. Users can either enter their own unique keyword into the search bar, or choose from four preset filters. This app will then load images associated with the users search which are pulled from unsplash.com using an API. Users can toggle through image pages by clicking on the 'Next' or 'Previous' buttons at the bottom of the screen. When a new keyword is searched, new images will reset to page one.
